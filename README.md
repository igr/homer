# Homer

Your `$HOME` needs **Homer** :)

**Homer** manages your dotfiles and folders using just `git`. No symlink is involved!
What makes **Homer** different is:

+ works directly in the $HOME
+ keeps tracking of added files, ignoring everythig else
+ fully track all added folders (!)

In other words, you pick files and folders from your `$HOME` and add it to your **Homer**. Everything else is ignored, which is very convenient when used in `$HOME`. **Homer** treats added files and folders differently:

+ files are simply tracked when they are added.
+ folders, hover, are fully synchronized! There is no need to add manually each new file from a folder. **Homer** will do all that. Of course, you can use `.gitignore` in the folders to simply ignore some files. This makes everyday-life much easier!

## Installation

Download `homer` to your `$PATH`. Done!

## Usage

First you need to initialize **Homer** and connect to GitHub by passing `user/repo_name`:

~~~ bash
homer init github-user/homer-repo
~~~

If you have another machine, just clone **Homer**:

~~~ bash
homer clone github-user/homer-repo
~~~

Anytime you can check the status of what is going on; what is new, changed deleted or untracked:

~~~ bash
homer status
~~~

Start adding files and folders.

~~~ bash
homer add .zsh
homer add bin
~~~

If you already have some folders added, you can simply add all untracked files with just:

~~~ bash
homer add
~~~

Finally, put your changes to the repo:

~~~ bash
homer put
~~~

On the another computer, get the changes:

~~~ bash
homer get
~~~
